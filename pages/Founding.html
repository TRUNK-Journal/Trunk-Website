			Trunk was founded in the 2024-2025 academic year by a group of dedicated undergraduate students from the University of Toronto. The founding team recognized the need for a platform that would allow students to showcase their research and creative work in STEM fields, fostering a sense of community and collaboration among peers. With a vision to highlight the excellence of undergraduate students, they established TRUNK as a student-led journal that would not only publish original work but also celebrate the achievements of the university's vibrant scientific community.
			<p> TRUNK was first conceptualized as a journal for undergraduate research in Computer Science by Aviraj Newatia at the Computer Science Student Union. After some initial planning and discussion with the Department of Computer Science, Aviraj reached out to Marty Hewitt at the Physics Student Union to expand the breadth of TRUNK to include Physics and other STEM fields. From then onwards, TRUNK grew to include the Mathematics, Chemistry, and Astronomy student unions for its first year.</p>
